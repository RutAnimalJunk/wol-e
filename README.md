## WOL-E ##

WOL-E is a suite of tools for the Wake on LAN feature of network attached computers, this is now enabled by default on many Apple computers. These tools include:

  * Bruteforcing the MAC address to wake up clients
  * Sniffing WOL attempts on the network and saving them to disk
  * Sniffing WOL passwords on the network and saving them to disk
  * Waking up single clients (post sniffing attack)
  * Scanning for Apple devices on the network for WOL enabling
  * Sending bulk WOL requests to all detected Apple clients.
